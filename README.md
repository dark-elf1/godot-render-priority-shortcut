# About
This plugin enables changing the render priority of specific node types while in editor with keys 1 and 2 on keyboard. It's useful for 3D scenes with a large number of nodes. You can select multiple nodes and change render priority of those nodes at the same time. Level designers should now have an easier time.

# Installation
Put the gd-render-priority-shortcut-plugin folder in your addons folder where your godot project is located. After that you can enable the plugin from project settings while in editor.
